We need Text Files from the PDFs of the Educational Content we are making our game from.
To do that, we need to get PDFs from our source, which is right now NCERT Official Website

We are taking PDFs of each chapter, from a Grade from a Subject, to make a game for that.

To get Text file from PDF:

1. Convert PDF into Images - Run Python File with all Required Libraries 
2. Convert Images into Text Files - Run Python File with all Required Libraries & Tesseract Engine for Optical Character Recognition
